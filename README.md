# libfprint-focaltech-0xc652

This project contains a test driver for libfprint with FocalTech's fingerprint sensor, specifically: 2808:c652.

## Status: Incomplete

This driver is incomplete and doesn't fully work. I need help, so if you wanna give it a shot go ahead!

## How to Run (Current State)

To run the existing Python script, navigate to the project directory and execute the following command:

```bash
python focaltech_test.py
```

It will generate a live image in the project directory where you can view the sensor's output data.
